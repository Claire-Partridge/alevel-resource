Hi! 

My name is Claire Partridge, I'm a 3rd year Physics student at the University of Liverpool.

This is my GitHub repository for the free access to an 'at-home lab' style guide to the A2 required practical; An investigation into Charles' and Boyle's Laws. 

So if you are an A-level Physics student, an A-level Physics teacher or you are just interested in Physics and want to try a home-based experiment, you are more than welcome to download and share! 

Don't forget who gets the credit though!


2 Resource Formats available to download: 

  
  * A Jupyter Notebook 'lab-style' practical guide with data analysis and evaluation sections
  * An Excel workbook practical guide with data analysis and evaluation sections
