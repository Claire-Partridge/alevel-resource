# alevel-resource

Hi! 

Claire here, hoping to figure this out so I can publish my resource on the internet for any and all A-level Physics students to access. 

This resource explores the A2 required practical of exploring Boyle's and Charles' Law. 
To be included within: 

  * Experimental Procedure (PDF and Jupyter Notebook)
   
  * Data Analysis and Lab Script Questions (Jupyter Notebook and Excel Spreadsheet)
   
  * Example Lab Report for Guidance?
