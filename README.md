Hi! 

My name is Claire Partridge, I'm a 3rd year Physics student at the University of Liverpool.

This is my GitHub repository for the free access to an 'at-home lab' style guide to the A2 required practical; An investigation into Charles' and Boyle's Laws. 

So if you are an A-level Physics student, an A-level Physics teacher or you are just interested in Physics and want to try a home-based experiment, you are more than welcome to download and share! 

Don't forget who gets the credit though!


2 Resource Formats available to download: 

  
  * A Jupyter Notebook 'lab-style' practical guide with data analysis and evaluation sections
  * An Excel workbook practical guide with data analysis and evaluation sections
   
If you are either; an a-level student looking at doing a lab-based science at university, or an a-level teacher, I would highly recommend using the Jupyter Notebook format of this activity. 
This Jupyter Notebook uses the coding laguage Python in a typical laboratory analysis format. If you have never learnt how to code, or experienced a coding procedure for the data analysis of an experiment then this worksheet is designed to give you a clear and steady introduction- starting with a basic explanation of the format along with links for further reading.

If you are new to Python and Jupyter Notebooks - first, you must download the software called 'Anaconda' onto your computer and launch Jupyter Notebook from the navigator. Only from here can you open the .ipynb file. 

For those of you with Python experience when you open the notebook, the first package 'RISE' isn't necessary to install if you don't want to, but the magic markdown package must be installed for the formatting to work at the end! 

I really hope you enjoy this at-home experiment, any and all feedback is more than welcome!



 ** __Disclaimer__ **

After reading through the method of this practical, please ensure you are constantly thinking about the safety of yourself and your equipment before embarking on adding data points. 

  

At no point should you be exposing your phone to any extreme temperatures â€“ this is a potential fire risk, and you could seriously damage your phone!  

It is recommended, for this investigation, to keep the temperature difference to no more than 10-20 degrees from room temperature.  

A bigger difference than this is unnecessary, you should be able to see the desired effect within these temperatures.  

 

There are ways to heat up the equipment WITHOUT using microwaves, ovens or hobs!!
